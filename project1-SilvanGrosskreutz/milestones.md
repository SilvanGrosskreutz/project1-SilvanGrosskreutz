# Milestones
> This file lays out a general timeline that you can follow to gauge your progress on P1. 
> We can break our project down into smaller MVPs in order to make it more manageable and ensure that there is ample time to complete each phase of development.
> As a first part to project 1, it is recommended to build a console-based application (interaction in Eclipse's console collecting user input) without a front end. This will require refactoring later but ensures that that the backend is fully functional by the time front-end development begins. 
> While meeting all these milestones for the project are not required, your trainer will be checking in weekly on the progress of your project during 1 on 1s and your answers there will be assessed as part of that evaluation.
